# Tim Corey's Suggestions Website

## Purpose

This website is built as a clone of [Tim Corey's Suggestions website](https://suggestions.iamtimcorey.com/). It was made as a training excersise, to practice programming in React.

## Tim Corey's course

Mr. Tim Corey has kindly made a course public on YouTube, where he teaches how a real project that he actually uses himself, can be made using C#, .NET 6, Blazor Server, MongoDb and Azure Active Directory B2C.

Corey explains both the web application and his course in his first lecture on YouTube that can be seen here: [https://youtu.be/eEyAKk4NeSg](https://youtu.be/eEyAKk4NeSg).

## The Technology

Apart from the obvious difference of using React instead of .NET here, we also have a different database and authentication system where Firebase replaces both MongoDb and Azure B2C. I found it a bit easier to work with Firebase than MongoDb in the contex of this application but Firebase also has some other things in it's favor. It is a "One Stop Shop" for a database, authentication and hosting. It also has the great feature of providing the option of listening to the data live so that changes in the database can be reflected immediately in the user's browser.

## Credits

All the UI design here is Tim Corey's and most of the CSS that makes the website look good was created by him. He is also of course the author of the application logic and this website is therefore mostly a translation of that code and logic into the different context of the React/Javascript world.

I also might "borrow" some suggestions or data from the real, live website, to have the data here looking a bit less silly.

Making this website has been a great experience that I have learned a lot from doing.
